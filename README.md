XRP Ledger Proposed Standard #5-L

Title:       Extended Addresses (X Addresses) - a "loosely" packed tagged address format
Author:      Elliot M. Lee
Affiliation: Ripple
Status:      Draft
Created:     2019-06-18

## Abstract

Destination tags provide a way for exchanges, payment processors, corporates or entities which accept incoming payments, escrows, checks and similar transactions to use a single receiving account (wallet) while being able to disambiguate incoming transactions by instructing the senders to include a destination tag.

This draft presents a way of encoding a tagged address: an address that contains both the target wallet as well as a destination tag as a single unit.

We further extend the tagged address to encode two other values:
- A network ID indicating whether the address is intended for use in production or in test
- An optional expiration to be enforced by client software

The result is referred to as an Extended Address or X Address.

Conveniently, when intended for use with the production XRP Ledger, addresses encoded in this format are defined to start with the letter X. This reduces the learning curve since X addresses will be immediately identifiable, even by users who are hearing of them for the first time.

## Motivation

Although flexible, destination tags suffer from several drawbacks.

Communicating a destination tag to users can be a problem for a number of reasons:

- In the absence of a standard format to represent an (address, tag) pair, different users of destination tags communicate the information in different ways.
- Users needs to enter two items, usually in two distinct input fields which may be inconsistently or confusingly named (e.g. one implementation refers to the destination tag as a "PIN").
- Programmers need to decide on how, when or even if the "Destination Tag" field must be surfaced, complicating panel layouts and increasing the potential for user confusion.
- The tag is an opaque identifier, generated by and meaningful only to the entity that will be receiving funds. Tags do not include a checksum to prevent against a user accidentally omitting or transposing digits or otherwise incorrectly entering a tag.

This proposal seeks to address this problem by defining a standard format to represent an (address, tag) which:

- Is expressed as a single string that shares all the desirable properties of existing addresses, including the ability to be selected by double-clicking on them.
- Eliminates the need for a separate "Destination Tag" field by allowing a single format to represent addresses both with and without tags.
- Includes a built-in checksum as a form of error-checking to reduce the probability that a typographical error will generate a correct address.

Furthermore, this new format distinguishes between production (aka mainnet) and test (aka test net or altnet); and adds an optional expiration, discussed in the next section.

### Motivation for expiration

Destination tags are 32-bit unsigned integers, so the maximum value is 2^32 - 1, or 4294967295. While this is a decent amount of granularity, it is not, for instance, enough to give each human on Earth a unique destination tag. Furthermore, we recommend against using sequential tags (i.e., do not auto-increment them) because these are public values permanently recorded in the ledger history and viewable by the world. For privacy, it is best to avoid a direct mapping of user accounts (for example, in an exchange's internal system) to destination tags. Also, this potentially reveals other information, such as the service's number of users.

The best way to use destination tags is to randomly assign them uniquely for each *transaction* (so that even a single user on a given system will make use of many different tags). This provides better privacy. Save the mapping internally (e.g. "Deposit for destination tag #1234 is designated for user #9876"). You could even limit the tag to one single use only. If an incoming payment has a destination tag that is not mapped to a user, you could send the money back with an error message.

Used in this way, a popular service could quickly run out of destination tags. To avoid this, the service can delete the mapping after some period of time.

There is a risk that a user will use an address/tag after it has been removed from the system, or after the service provider no longer wants any funds to be sent to that destination tag. Thus, an expiring address/tag is useful in many of the cases where destination tags are used.

See "[Use cases for expiration](#use-cases-for-expiration)" for an overview of envisioned use cases for expiration.

## Limitations

We are not looking to change the on-ledger format; that is, the new style addresses can't be used for fields where an `AccountID` is expected in the binary format. Instead, the packed address will be detected and decoded at higher levels (for example, by the client software, `ripple-lib` or the RPC and WebSocket APIs in `rippled`), verified and then split into distinct fields (e.g. `sfDestination` and `sfDestinationTag`) as appropriate, to assemble the underlying transaction.

This new address style incorporates the destination tag, network ID, and expiration, and a checksum that ensures it has not been accidentally corrupted. By updating software to understand such Extended Addresses, we improve the UX, while intelligently unpacking such addresses into their constituent parts for the underlying system.

#### Limitations of expiration

The expiration can be enforced by the X address decoder, where an expired address will be detected as "invalid". The sender should refuse to send to the expired address, and the user should fetch a new address/tag from the service provider.

There are no changes to transactions or consensus for expiration support; it will be trivial for advanced users to override the expiration. However, it is a very valuable feature to have because defines a specific lifetime for an address/tag pair, sets expectations, and prevents user error.

## Options

Although we have options in developing a new format, including what encoding to use, ideally the resulting addresses will be similar to existing addresses to reduce the likelihood of user confusion as much as possible. Also, it should not require developers to implement a new codec.

Given this constraint, we need to use Base58 encoding, leaving us with two options:

1. A "tightly packed" format, where the account ID—or "classic address"—and tag are encoded using Base58Check as a single unit.
2. A "loosely packed" format, where the classic address is encoded using Base58Check and the destination tag is encoded separately and concatenated into the new address.

The advantage of the "loose" format is that a portion (or substring) of the tagged address will precisely match the classic address. The "tight" format results in an address that shares no common characters with the classic address, except, perhaps, by chance.

The "loose" format has a security advantage because it prevents a malicious actor from modifying the address in the conversion step without being detected. While not all users will care for this level of security, many advanced users will take advantage of this feature to visually observe that the tagged address contains the expected classic address and tag.

Furthermore, the format adds three additional benefits:
1. The network ID distinguishes addresses intended for production from those intended for test.
2. The checksum comes near the beginning of the address. Since the checksum is built on SHA256, it changes dramatically with any small change in the classic address and/or tag and/or network ID and/or expiration. This allows users to distinguish addresses by looking at them, if necessary.
3. An Extended Address is clearly distinct from a classic address because of its dissimilar initial letter. This is a benefit from a UX perspective because it is easy to distinguish Extended Addresses from classic addresses, which is necessary because not all software will immediately accept Extended Addresses in all of the places where classic addresses are currently accepted. This point will be elaborated upon later in this document.

As will be shown below, the format proposed here is not complex to detect, encode, or decode.

Though it is a "loose" format in the sense that the classic address and tag are readable within the new encoding, these tagged addresses can be used as a full replacement for classic addresses in end-user UIs. The tag is optional, so even addresses not intended to be used with a tag can be encoded with this format.

Regardless of whether we choose a "tightly packed" or "loosely packed" format, developers will always need to be aware of the classic addresses and destination tags because they are used in the ledger itself, in transaction signing, and in transaction parsing and accounting.

## Status

This is only a proposal. It is intended to generate discussion between developers, community members and other interested parties, in hopes that that we will reach consensus on the way forward.

Comments, criticisms, suggestions and improvements are welcome!

## Proposal

### Addresses and Destination Tags

For a better introduction to addresses and tags, it may help to reference https://developers.ripple.com/accounts.html.

### Existing Format

Currently, an address is generated by base58-encoding (with a checksum) a 21 byte buffer:

`[← 1 byte prefix →|← 160 bits of account ID →]`

The chosen byte prefix is `TokenType::AccountID` (value 0)

This base58-encoded string is referred to as a "classic address".

### Proposed Format

The new format combines five items together. Note that the following is not a buffer to be encoded, but a representation of the final Extended Address itself:

`[← 1 network ID →|← encode(required checksum + optional expiration) →|0|← tag →|← classic address →]`

In the proposed format, the following values are concatenated together:

1. An initial character indicating the network ID.
2. A base58-encoded value containing an optional expiration timestamp and a checksum.
3. A delimiter, chosen to be '0'.
4. A tag.
5. A classic address.

#### 1. Network ID

This character is chosen to be 'X' for production and 'T' for test.

#### 2. Base58-encoded Value

The base58-encoded value contains a required checksum and an optional expiration timestamp.

The timestamp is expressed in [the same way as time in the XRP Ledger](https://xrpl.org/basic-data-types.html#specifying-time), with a 32-bit unsigned integer measuring the number of seconds since the XRP Ledger "epoch" of January 1, 2000 (00:00 UTC).

The checksum is calculated in a similar manner to a classic address's checksum, but note that is a checksum over _all_ of the data represented by the extended address.

The checksum is calculated with the following steps.
1. Decode the account ID from the classic address.
2. Encode the expiration as a little endian 32-bit unsigned integer. If the address does not expire, encode this as zero bytes (effectively omitting it in step 5).
3. Encode the tag as a little endian 32-bit unsigned integer. If no tag should be used, encode this as zero bytes (effectively omitting it in step 5).
4. Encode the network ID character as one byte. Since the only network IDs are 'X' and 'T', `utf8` and `ascii` encoding yield the same result.
5. Concatenate these values in the following order: `Buffer.concat([networkByte, expirationBuffer, tagBuffer, accountID])`
6. Run the data through a double SHA256 hash. The checksum is the first 4 bytes.

Encode the expiration with the checksum, in base58. Put the checksum first so that any change to the address/tag/network/expiration will change the first several characters of the resulting address, aiding visual identification of addresses.

```ts
codec.encode(Buffer.concat([checksum, expirationBuffer]));
```

#### 3. Delimiter

The delimiter prevents ambiguity between the checksum and the tag, making parsing simpler. It must be a character that does not appear in our base58 alphabet, so it can only be '0' or 'l'. With this specification, '0' is chosen.

#### 4. Tag

The tag is included as-is, converted to a string. For example, a tag of `16781933` becomes "16781933" inside the resulting X address. This makes parsing simple, and aids user recognition, improving the UX.

64-bit tags can be supported by including them as-is (in decimal format, the same way that 32-bit tags are represented).

If no tag should be used, this section is omitted from the X address.

#### 5. Classic address

The classic address is included as-is. As a result, the account ID is 'checked' by two different checksums. Practically, this redundancy is harmless, and also benefits users and developers by reinforcing the 1:1 correspondence between an X address's account ID and a classic address.

### Encoding Examples

In the following table, we present how the classic address `rGWrZyQqhTp9Xu7G5Pkayo7bXjH4k4QYpf` would be encoded under this spec to include various destination tags, with an expiration date of 2019-12-31T23:59:59. The tag, if any, is on the left most column, followed by the tagged address. The network ID of these tagged addresses implies that they are intended for use in production.

#### Expiration is optional

Extended addresses do not need to have an expiration. Here are the same classic address and tag encodings, but with no expiration:

### Advantages

Both the account ID and the destination tag are protected by the 32-bit checksum.
We can determine whether the address is an Extended Address by examining the initial character of the address: if it is `X` or `T` it is a packed address which may include a tag; if it is `r` it does not. If the initial character is anything else, the address is malformed.

The packed address's "suffix" is the same as the unpacked address, which can be useful and comforting to users (since it is clear which classic address is encoded by the packed address).

This consistency can be especially helpful for users in the context of trust lines, where the issuer of an asset must be explicitly trusted.

### Disadvantages

Support for Extended Addresses must be added to client software, which may take time.

Parsing an Extended Address is more complex than only parsing a classic address.

#### Amelioration

Users will be able to easily tell if the address they want to use is an X address or not, simply by looking at the first character.

Exchanges etc. can use explanatory verbiage such as: "We have added support for X addresses."

If "X address" sounds too colloquial, they can say: "We have added support for Extended Addresses." However, this may be less informative since it is not immediately obvious how to tell whether an address is an Extended Address or not.

For client software developers, to facilitate adoption and testing of the new format, open source tagged address parsers will be included in `ripple-lib` and made available in multiple programming languages.

### Transaction Example

Consider the following transaction submission:

```
rippled submit secret '{
    "TransactionType":"Payment",
    "Account":"r3kmLJN5D28dHuH8vZNUZpMC43pEHpaocV",
    "Amount":"200000000",
    "Destination":"XpwjJ430276rGWrZyQqhTp9Xu7G5Pkayo7bXjH4k4QYpf"
}'
```

The server would unpack `XpwjJ430276rGWrZyQqhTp9Xu7G5Pkayo7bXjH4k4QYpf` to `rGWrZyQqhTp9Xu7G5Pkayo7bXjH4k4QYpf` and a destination tag of 276, and process the submission as if it had been:

```
rippled submit secret '{
    "TransactionType":"Payment",
    "Account":"r3kmLJN5D28dHuH8vZNUZpMC43pEHpaocV",
    "Amount":"200000000",
    "Destination":"rGWrZyQqhTp9Xu7G5Pkayo7bXjH4k4QYpf",
    "DestinationTag":276
}'
```

Obviously the server cannot do this when presented with a pre-signed transaction, although assembling and signing a transaction using an unexpanded packed address shouldn't be possible, since the binary encoding of an AccountID requires exactly 20 bytes.

Third party tools that accept user input should allow users to enter such addresses and transparently expand them prior to signing and/or submitting.

### Use cases for expiration

Often, destination tags should not be valid forever. Given XRP's fast transaction speed, it should be reasonable to have tags expire in relatively short periods of time. When generating an address, randomly assign a new destination tag to the user, as described above. Beyond that, here are some rough guidelines/expectations:

- **Exchanges:** It is reasonable to have the tag expire in 24-48 hours from generation, and indicate this fact to the client on the deposit page of the site. Internally, the exchange can allow some leeway for internal accounting, not deleting/invalidating the tag <-> client mapping for, say, 3 days. If the exchange wants or needs to transition away from the use of a particular account, expirations provide the exchange with some assurance that clients should stop sending to the old account within a few days.
- **Merchants:** It is reasonable to have the tag expire shortly after the merchant expects the customer to send the payment. For example, if the merchant expects payment in about 2 minutes, the merchant can set the address to expire in 5 minutes. Remember that a customer can request a new address if they fail to make payment in the expected timeframe, and the merchant can (if it chooses) simply generate a new X Address for the same account and tag as before, merely extending the expiration.

Of course, shorter or longer expirations should be fine as well; it's a convenience trade-off. It's not a bad idea to set that an address expires in a year, for example; the account does not actually become invalid or anything. It is merely an indicator to the sender that they should check with the recipient (out of band) to make sure there isn't a different address that they would now prefer.

Note that expiration is optional, so service providers can always generate addresses that never expire. It is only an additional layer of safety, akin to encoding tags in addresses: it eliminates a class of potential mistakes. Expirations are for convenience and do not affect anything in the ledger data or transaction data.

Generally, the rule of thumb is that the expiration should prevent misuse without extra knowledge or effort from users.

## Questions

Below is a list of questions and answers:

### Should the format include both a source and a destination tag?

Probably not. It's better to simply state that the new format specifies an "address and tag" and to allow such addresses to be used both as a source and as a destination, and to decide the tag's type (source or destination) based on the field.

### Can we craft an encoding so that a packed address shares commonality with the actual address?

Yes, this proposal does this by encoding the classic address and destination tag separately and fusing the two components. Furthermore, the decoding process is not very complicated.

### There's potential for confusion. Can we help?

Users may not understand the semantics of an Extended Address sufficiently. This means that errors or confusion are possible as a result. Two exchange users might wonder why their deposit addresses are now different. Or one user may ask a friend what the deposit address is and, unknowingly, deposit funds into their friend's account.
The first is obviously not a problem with existing addresses, and the second is less likely to be an issue with single-use Extended Addresses. The UX of third parties that choose to use the new format will have to make it clear to users that the address is unique for them.

The server could add information to the metadata associated with a transaction to help tools to map addresses. For example, the server could add the following:

```
"TaggedAddresses": [
    { 
        "XpwjJ430276rGWrZyQqhTp9Xu7G5Pkayo7bXjH4k4QYpf": {
            "Address": "rGWrZyQqhTp9Xu7G5Pkayo7bXjH4k4QYpf",
            "Tag": 276
        }
    }
]
```

### Why not BECH32?

The BECH32 format is great and has several advantages over Base58, including speed. We are defining a new address encoding here, so why not just go for that? It's an option, but we decided to be conservative and not require new code to be written or incorporated into servers, clients and libraries.

### What happens if someone specifies one of these addresses in the binary format?

The short answer is that they can't. The serialization field only allows exactly 20 bytes, so only the account itself can fit in. This format is only for base58 encoded addresses and is purely a convenience for users.

### Should we integrate this natively into the protocol?

No. It would be a huge change and, potentially, breaking one and there aren't any advantages that I can see. There are many risks. Allowing APIs to understand the new format sufficiently to decompose it into its two constituent fields should be sufficient.

## Sample TypeScript/JavaScript Implementation

The following is an example of a TypeScript function which will encode an Extended Address in a way that complies with this specification:

```ts
// 1. Decode classicAddress to accountID
const accountID: Buffer = decodeAccountID(this.classicAddress);

// 2. Encode networkID
let myNetworkByte: Buffer;
if (this.networkID === 'production') {
  myNetworkByte = Buffer.from('X');
} else if (this.networkID === 'test') {
  myNetworkByte = Buffer.from('T');
} else {
  throw new Error(`Invalid networkID: ${this.networkID}`);
}
const networkByte = myNetworkByte;

// 3. Convert tag to Buffer (UInt32LE)
let myTagBuffer: Buffer;
if (this.tag !== undefined) {
  if (Number.isInteger(this.tag) === false) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid tag: ${this.tag}`);
  }
  myTagBuffer = Buffer.alloc(8); // 8 bytes = 64 bits
  myTagBuffer.writeUInt32LE(this.tag, 0);
} else {
  myTagBuffer = Buffer.alloc(0);
}
const tagBuffer: Buffer = myTagBuffer;

// 4. Convert expiration to Buffer (UInt32LE)
let myExpirationBuffer: Buffer;
if (this.expiration !== undefined) {
  if (Number.isInteger(this.expiration) === false) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid expiration: ${this.expiration}`);
  }
  myExpirationBuffer = Buffer.alloc(4); // 4 bytes = 32 bits
  myExpirationBuffer.writeUInt32LE(this.expiration, 0);
} else {
  myExpirationBuffer = Buffer.alloc(0); // no expiration
}
const expirationBuffer: Buffer = myExpirationBuffer;

// 5. Concat networkByte, expirationBuffer, tagBuffer, and accountID
//    to create the payload to be checksummed.
//    NB: The ordering of these values has been changed from an earlier draft of this spec.
const payload = Buffer.concat([networkByte, expirationBuffer, tagBuffer, accountID]);

// 6. SHA256 x 2 and take first 4 bytes as checksum
const checksum = sha256(sha256(payload)).slice(0, 4);

// 7. Encode the expiration with the checksum, in base58.
//    NB: Put the checksum first so that any change to the address/tag/network/expiration
//        changes the first several characters of the resulting address.
const checksumAndExpirationBase58 = codec.encode(Buffer.concat([checksum, expirationBuffer]));

// 8. Decide to use '0' as our delimiter. It must be a character that
//    does not appear in our base58 alphabet, so it can only be '0' or 'l'
const DELIMITER = '0';

// 9. Form the "X Address" and return it:
//    - Start with 'X' or 'T' to make the address format obvious;
//    - Lead with the checksum so that any (valid) change to the
//      address/tag/network/expiration changes the first several characters of
//      the resulting address;
//    - Append the tag next for easy parsing.
//      To get the tag, take everything between DELIMITER and 'r'
//      (since a classic address will always start with 'r').
//      Notice that if we had put the tag after the address, we would
//      need to add a second delimiter to avoid ambiguity: the numbers
//      1-9 are all valid base58 characters in our alphabet.
//      An added benefit of this approach is that the tag, in the middle
//      of the string, (correctly) appears to be opaque and not user-editable.
//    - Finish with the classic address.
const tagString = this.tag !== undefined ? this.tag.toString() : '';
return new XAddress(networkByte.toString() + checksumAndExpirationBase58 + DELIMITER + tagString + this.classicAddress);
```

This requires some supporting code; please [view the full implmentation here](./src/x-address.ts).

To run the example (requires node.js and npm):

1. Clone this git repo
2. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run compile`
3. Run `node . ADDRESS [TAG] [NETWORK ID]`

Try:

```
node . Xscra3e00rGWrZyQqhTp9Xu7G5Pkayo7bXjH4k4QYpf
```

```
node . rGWrZyQqhTp9Xu7G5Pkayo7bXjH4k4QYpf 0 production
```

To encode an address that should not use a tag, substitute `undefined` for the tag. Similarly, tagged addresses without a tag will, in legacy address format, show `undefined` for the tag. The utility supports converting multiple addresses at once; separate addresses with a space.

You can also build binaries for Linux, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows: `npm run build`

Binaries will be output in the `./bin` directory.
